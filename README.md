# bootstrap-portfolio

This assignment required the use of bootstrap classes to rebuild the Basic Porfolio.

Used BOOTSTRAP nav, form, container-fluid, img-fluid and footer classes to rebuid pages.

Found the use of Bootstrap not practical when I tried to insert bootstrap classes into a previously completed and functional HTML/CSS.

Couldn't seem to get the pages to behave until I rebuilt from scratch.
